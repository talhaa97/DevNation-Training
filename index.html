        <h3>About the game</h3>
        <p>
            God of War is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released worldwide on April 20, 2018, for the PlayStation 4 with a Microsoft Windows version released on January 14, 2022.

        <p>Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus
            behind him, Kratos now lives in the realm of Norse deities and monsters.It’s in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive, and not only teach his son to do the same… but also prevent him from repeating the Ghost of Sparta’s bloodstained mistakes.
            This staggering reimagining of God of War combines all the hallmarks of the iconic series – brutal combat, epic boss fights, and breathtaking scale – and fuses them with a powerful and moving narrative that re-establishes Kratos’ world.

            I tested the individual graphics options in God of War to find the best settings. My testing was originally done at 4K, focusing solely on the graphics card. However, I referenced the presets several times during testing at different resolutions to make sure
            the performance would scale.Thankfully, there aren’t too many options to tweak. Here are the best settings for God of War:
            <ul>Texture quality: High</ul>
            <ul>Anisotropic filtering: High</ul>
            <ul>Model quality: High</ul>
            <ul>Shadows: High</ul>
            <ul>Reflections: Original</ul>
            <ul>Atmospherics: Original</ul>
            <ul>Atmospherics: Original</ul>
